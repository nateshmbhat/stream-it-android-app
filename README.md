# Stream It

**The power to stream tons of music from your PCs onto your phones effortlessly.**


### Problem Statement : 

Many times that we've run out of memory space in phones and are not able to keep much of our music content in our phones for long. One of the ways to overcome is to use any music app. But the downside is that it consumes mobile data everytime we wish to play music and even if we can download songs, our memory runs out pretty fast. But you can store all your vast music content in your PCs and hard disks easily. This project aims to make it possible to stream that content to your phones without need for storage space on phones. 



## Features : 

+ Desktop app which displays all your music in the folders that you allow. 
+ Nice and clean GUI interface for the desktop app.
+ The music content on the PC is displayed in the phoneâ€™s Android app. 
+ Uses socket programming to achieve the communication between PC and phone. 
+ Select the required music which starts its streaming from PC without need to wait for it download or transfer any file. 
The streaming can be controlled with various options like pause, forward, backward.
+ Along with music also grabs and shows metadata about the music. 
+ No waiting time in the streaming experience. 
+ No storage of songs in the phone involved. So memory is never used for music.
